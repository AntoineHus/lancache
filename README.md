Game Update Caching for LAN Parties

Initially pulled from http://blog.multiplay.co.uk/2014/04/lancache-dynamically-caching-game-installs-at-lans-using-nginx/

This repository will include my changes to adapt the configuration from FreeBSD to Ubuntu and tweak the paths to it my environment.

To utilize these config files, install nginx version 1.6.0 or greater and place these files in the configuration directory (usually /etc/nginx)

**NOTICE: Debian versions before jessie and all versions of Ubuntu as of this writing do not have a recent enough version nf nginx in their repositories.  You must install a newer version some other way.**
